<h2> Important Points : </h2>
<ol style="font-family:verdana; font-size: 16px">
<li> The eighteenth century has gifted English literature two entirely new forms which are ‘The Periodical Essay’ and the other was ‘NOVEL'. </li>
<br>
<li> A novel is a relatively long narrative fiction which describes intimate human experiences normally in a prose form. The present English word ‘novel’ is derived from the Italian ‘novella’, meaning ‘new’. A novel narrates a story embellishing it with more details of time, place, nature, people and their minds, their gestures and activities. </li>
<br>
<li> Early precursors of novel a collection of tales known as Greek Romances dating from the second to sixth century may top the list. These imaginative and delightful stories of ideal love and marvellous adventures profoundly affected the creative writing for the next thousand years. </li>
<br>
<li> Murasaki Shikibu’s ‘Tale of Genji’ (1010) has been described as the world’s first novel. The European novel is often said to begin with ‘Don Quixote’ by Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes which was published in two parts between 1605 and1615. </li>
